=======================================
 Installation of gtimelog for Mac OS X
=======================================

Prerequisites
=============

- You need to install MacPorts from http://www.macports.org/

- gtimelog needs gtk+.

  - to install it for X11 call

    sudo port install gtk2 +x11

  - to install gtk+ for quartz call

    sudo port install cairo +no_x11+quartz
    sudo port install pango +no_x11+quartz
    sudo port install gtk2 +no_x11

- gtimelog needs some other components, install them using:

  python 2.5:

    sudo port install py25-gtk py25-setuptools py25-lxml py25-socket-ssl py25-pip

  python 2.6 (Change also the path to python in gtimelogrc later on.):

    sudo port install py26-gtk py26-setuptools py26-lxml py26-pip

  (when an error is displayed that a component can't be installed, try
   the call again.)


Installation
============

- Create a directory .gtimelog in your home directory

- Copy orig/gtimelogrc.example to $HOME/.gtimelog/gtimelogrc and change the
  paramaters as needed. (See also orig/README.txt)

- Install the gocept.gtimelog egg:

  python 2.5:

    sudo /opt/local/bin/easy_install-2.5 -f http://download.gocept.com/packages gocept.gtimelog

  python 2.6:

    sudo /opt/local/bin/easy_install-2.6 -f http://download.gocept.com/packages gocept.gtimelog

When using python2.5 you'll need to edit the runner in "gtimelog.app/Contents/MacOS/gtimelog" manually.
