=======================================
 Installation of gtimelog for Mac OS X
=======================================

Prerequisites
=============

- You need to install MacPorts from http://www.macports.org/

- gtimelog needs gtk+.

  - to install it for X11 call

    sudo port install gtk2 +x11

  - to install gtk+ for quartz call

    sudo port install cairo +no_x11+quartz
    sudo port install pango +no_x11+quartz
    sudo port install gtk2 +no_x11

- gtimelog needs some other components, install them using:

  python 2.5:

    sudo port install py25-gtk py25-setuptools py25-lxml py25-socket-ssl

  python 2.6 (Change also the path to python in gtimelogrc later on.):

    sudo port install py26-gtk py26-setuptools py26-lxml

  (when an error is displayed that a component can't be installed, try
   the call again.)

- Copy orig/gtimelogrc.example to $HOME/.gtimelog/gtimelogrc and change the
