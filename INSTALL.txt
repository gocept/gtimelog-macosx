=======================================
 Installation of gtimelog for Mac OS X
=======================================

Prerequisites
=============

- You need to install MacPorts from http://www.macports.org/

- gtimelog needs gtk+.

  - to install it for X11 call

    sudo port install cairo +x11
    sudo port install pango +x11
    sudo port install gtk2 +x11

  - to install gtk+ for quartz call

    sudo port install cairo +no_x11+quartz
    sudo port install pango +no_x11+quartz
    sudo port install gtk2 +no_x11

- gtimelog needs some other components, install them using:

  - python 2.6 (Change also the path to python in gtimelogrc later on.):

    sudo port install py26-gtk py26-setuptools py26-lxml py26-pip

  - or python 2.5:

    sudo port install py25-gtk py25-setuptools py25-lxml py25-socket-ssl py25-pip

  (when an error is displayed that a component can't be installed, try
   the call again.)

Switch between X11 and quartz variant
-------------------------------------

- To switch between X11 and quartz you have to install gtk+ for the
  new variant (see above).

- Uninstall the previous variant:

  sudo port uninstall inactive

- Then you have to uninstall the python bindings and a variant
  dependent library:

  sudo port uninstall py26-gtk py26-cairo
  sudo port uninstall libglade2

- And reinstall them

  sudo port install py26-gtk

- Then you can restart gtimelog which than runs using the new UI variant.


Installation
============

- Create a directory .gtimelog in your home directory

- Copy orig/gtimelogrc.example to $HOME/.gtimelog/gtimelogrc and change the
  paramaters as needed. (See also orig/README.txt)

- Install the gocept.gtimelog egg:

  - python 2.6:

    sudo /opt/local/bin/easy_install-2.6 -f http://download.gocept.com/packages gocept.gtimelog

  - python 2.5:

    sudo /opt/local/bin/easy_install-2.5 -f http://download.gocept.com/packages gocept.gtimelog


When using python2.5 you'll need to edit the runner in "gtimelog.app/Contents/MacOS/gtimelog" manually.

Usage
=====

- Double click on gtimelog.app to start it.

Update
======

- Update the gocept.gtimelog egg:

  - python 2.6:

    sudo /opt/local/bin/easy_install-2.6 -U -f http://download.gocept.com/packages gocept.gtimelog

  - python 2.5:

    sudo /opt/local/bin/easy_install-2.5 -U -f http://download.gocept.com/packages gocept.gtimelog
